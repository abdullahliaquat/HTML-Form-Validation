# HTML-Form-Validation
This repository contains HTML and CSS files for SignIn and SignUp forms, along with JavaScript code to perform front-end validation for various input fields such as username, password, email, age, etc.

# Validations
Some of the validatins that I have added include;
- If any field reamins empty, there will be a message that will request the user to fill all fields
- If fields are completed, the sign in or sign up will be done successfully
- User can directly go from Sigin to Signup page if he/she doesn't have an account

# Snapshots
Here are both of the forms (SignIn and SignUp):
